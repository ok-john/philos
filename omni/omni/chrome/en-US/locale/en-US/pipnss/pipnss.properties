PSMERR_SSL_Disabled=Can’t connect securely because the SSL protocol has been disabled.
PSMERR_SSL2_Disabled=Can’t connect securely because the site uses an older, insecure version of the SSL protocol.
PSMERR_HostReusedIssuerSerial=You have received an invalid certificate.  Please contact the server administrator or email correspondent and give them the following information:\n\nYour certificate contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the certificate authority.  Please get a new certificate containing a unique serial number.

SSLConnectionErrorPrefix2=An error occurred during a connection to %1$S. %2$S\n

certErrorIntro=%S uses an invalid security certificate.

certErrorTrust_SelfSigned=The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer2=The server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates.
certErrorTrust_UnknownIssuer3=An additional root certificate may need to be imported.
certErrorTrust_CaInvalid=The certificate is not trusted because it was issued by an invalid CA certificate.
certErrorTrust_Issuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.
certErrorTrust_SignatureAlgorithmDisabled=The certificate is not trusted because it was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because that algorithm is not secure.
certErrorTrust_ExpiredIssuer=The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate has expired.
certErrorTrust_Untrusted=The certificate does not come from a trusted source.
certErrorTrust_MitM=Your connection is being intercepted by a TLS proxy. Uninstall it if possible or configure your device to trust its root certificate.

certErrorNotYetValidNow=The certificate will not be valid until %1$S. The current time is %2$S.

certErrorMitM=Websites prove their identity via certificates, which are issued by certificate authorities.
certErrorMitM2=%S is backed by the non-profit Mozilla, which administers a completely open certificate authority (CA) store. The CA store helps ensure that certificate authorities are following best practices for user security.
certErrorMitM3=%S uses the Mozilla CA store to verify that a connection is secure, rather than certificates supplied by the user’s operating system. So, if an antivirus program or a network is intercepting a connection with a security certificate issued by a CA that is not in the Mozilla CA store, the connection is considered unsafe.

certErrorSymantecDistrustAdministrator=You may notify the website’s administrator about this problem.
